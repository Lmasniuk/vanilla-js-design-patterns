/*
Factory Pattern

Purpose: 

"We can use factory functions in order to create new objects. A function is a factory function when it returns a new object without the use of the new keyword!""


Pros
- The factory pattern is useful when we have to create multiple smaller objects that share the same properties. A factory function can easily return a custom object depending on the current environment, or user-specific configuration.

Cons
- In JavaScript, the factory pattern isnâ€™t much more than a function that returns an object without using the new keyword. ES6 arrow functions allow us to create small factory functions that implicitly return an object each time.



Notes:
- Different than classes because it doesn't use the new keyword.
- Different than classes because it doesn't set up a prototype chain. (inheritance is done manually)
- Less efficient than classes because methods are redefined for every instance unless reused explicitly.
- Factory functions allow you to dynamically assemble objects with different structures at runtime, which may not be as straightforward with classes.
- More functional way of doing things
