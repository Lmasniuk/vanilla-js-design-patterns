/*
Command Pattern

Purpose: We can use this pattern to decouple the execution of a method on an object

"With the Command Pattern, we can decouple objects that execute a certain task from the object that calls the method."

Pros
- The command pattern allows us to decouple methods from the object that executes the operation. It gives you more control if youâ€™re dealing with commands that have a certain lifespan, or commands that should be queued and executed at specific times.

Cons
- The use cases for the command pattern are quite limited, and often adds unnecessary boilerplate to an application.
